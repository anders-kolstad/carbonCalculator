# Analyses of peatland carbon stocks

Here I document the data and analyses behind the manuscript _A calculator for peatland volume and carbon stock to support area planners and decision makers._ (Kyrkjeeide et al. in prep). The documentation exists both as a [dynamic web page](https://anders-kolstad.github.io/carbonCalculator/), and as a static pdf that came with the original publication. 

This web page or pdf was build `r Sys.time()`

The analyses here are done by Kolstad based on initial work of Fandrem.
