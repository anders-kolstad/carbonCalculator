Analyses of peat volume and carbon stock in Norwegian mires

This is mainly the work of [Marte Fandrem](https://github.com/martef). The data includes peat characteristics from numerous mires across Norway, and peat depth measurements from 4 mires.

The work is also manifested in [CarbonViewer](https://carbonviewer.nina.no/)
